Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\\nI am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.\\n\\nPerhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.\\n\\nSorry, I cannot recommend.\\n\\nSample provided in exchange for an honest review.</td>\n","      <td>Works well if you place phone in horizontally (landscape mode).

use this.  Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\\nI am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.\\n\\nPerhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.\\n\\nSorry, I cannot recommend.\\n\\nSample provided in exchange for an honest review.</td>\n","      <td>Works well if you place phone in horizontally (landscape mode).

They worked quite well for about 3 years, and then the riser seals started to go bad. The seals started to calcify and became warped, causing sprinklers to leak and/or not pop up at all. I tried cleaning the seals and soaking in CLR, but this did not solve the issue.\\n\\nOrdinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals.</td>\n","      <td>Lasts for a few years, then needs to be replaced</td>\n","      <td>1466812800</td>\n","

Children can relate to that quite well. Getting him back is a good lesson in itself. Sewing the pocket on for him is delightful. It has a happy ending which is most enjoyable. Further note, when I read the Corduroy books to little people, I always tried to have an example of corduroy material with me - either on as pants, etc. Some of the children did not know what corduroy was.

Children can relate to that quite well. Getting him back is a good lesson in itself. Sewing the pocket on for him is delightful. It has a happy ending which is most enjoyable.

Sometimes I would accidentally yank the printer off the table because the UPS labels were difficult to tear off.

work in my car. I ran it through my entire car and it performed well. I was able to vacuum up dust on the dash and steering wheel. But what I liked was that I could get the dust out of the radio buttons and air vents with the brush attachment. I didn't try the air pump capability but this could come in handy if you get a flat on the road. So It will stay in my car for sure. I grabbed some sand and threw in on the floor to demonstrate how well it vacuums for you in case you were wondering too. But overall, I do recommend this vacuum cleaner and I would purchase this again. I will update my review it quits working within a few months. But so far it seems good.</td>\n","      <td>Wrosk better than I expected!!!</td>\n","      <td>1473724800</td>\n","      <td>134</td>\n","      <td>automotive</td>\n","      <td>True</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>719</th>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>True</td>\n","      <td>02 22, 2014</td>\n","      <td>A1DNT986OPD9Z5</td>\n","      <td>B00002243Z</td>\n","      <td>satisfied customer</td>\n","      <td>Purchased for rainy day, have not used them yet.

However, a friend brought up one caveat, which is that with keyless ignition, one can't always go power plug to power plug.

They are a nice set of light duty battery clips - perfect for the little battery in my Prius.</td>\n","      <td>Good for a Prius</td>\n","      <td>1402012800</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>automotive</td>\n","      <td>True</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2460</th>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>08 1, 2015</td>\n","      <td>A33DXDUPM6OE8V</td>\n","      <td>B00009V3ZE</td>\n","      <td>Matt M</td>\n","      <td>It works, but it's brown in color.

The colors are so much better than the primary colors or pastel variety I can buy at the discount store. In this bag are golds and silvers, more than one shade of greens, blues, etc..and some unique colors like a sort of burnt gold/orange, and a pretty turquoise.\\nWhat is nice about this assortment is that there is a good mixture of the colors. I did not receive an excessive amount of any certain color. There was a pretty good sprinkling of the different colors in my bag.\\nThese balloons are durable and have held their air for several days without deflating. These are not huge balloons, about average. So if you try to over-inflate them, they will obviously pop on you sooner.\\nIf you are looking for a unique variety of colorful balloons, this is a great choice.\\nI received this item for evaluation and review.</td>\n","      <td>Rainbow in a Bag</td>\n","      <td>1467590400</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>toys</td>\n","      <td>True</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1827865</th>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>True</td>\n","      <td>09 19, 2017</td>\n","      <td>A26D1M5FNREVKG</td>\n","      <td>B01GPU5TQI</td>\n","      <td>Jay</td>\n","      <td>&lt;div id=\"video-block-R3VSLIHA0ARQ12\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/G1olhbg4C2S.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"&gt;&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eCJCDUuFS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Got my HUBSAN H109S X4 Pro High advance and 3 extra batteries from Mifly drone fast shipping and everything was packed neatly :-) this is the best drone I have owned I have a few toy grade drones I used to learn on before stepping up to hobby grade drone, The 1080P HD camera are tuned amazingly to capture stunning pictures and videos from the sky. GPS position and hovering, making the flight more accurate and safer.  Getting around 20-25min fly while recording, FPV works wonderful clear video no lag,  Return to home works like it should when I 1st tested Return to home I tied fishing string to the drone in case it decided to fly away on its own but it worked 100%  perfectly  landing right where it took off or next to it my only complaint is when I  received the drone the wire that moves the gimbal left and right had been ripped off its plug but a little solder fixed that problem and now it works.  Will buy again from Mifly Drone.  I  have included a few pictures and videos so you can see the quality of the camera pictures were taken at sunset .</td>\n","      <td>Love it!!</td>\n","      <td>1505779200</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>toys</td>\n","      <td>True</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1827916</th>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>10 8, 2016</td>\n","      <td>A10AIA4VPWP6NO</td>\n","      <td>B01GRK6L0Y</td>\n","      <td>Svitlana S.</td>\n","      <td>&lt;div id=\"video-block-R1W7WO6Y0EBWP6\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D19R1Tmg66S.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"&gt;&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91-AmGewNzS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pros: The plastic color is pleasantly bright.

It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.\\n\\nI find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.\\n\\nThe brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.\\n\\nThat said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.\\n\\nEverything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.\\n\\nInitially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.\\n\\nUltimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.\\n\\nI was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.</td>\n","      <td>Works</td>\n","      <td>1469059200</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>automotive</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>I like this mini vacuum. It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.\\n\\nI find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.\\n\\nThe brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.\\n\\nThat said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.\\n\\nEverything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.\\n\\nInitially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter.

Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap.

A Pocket for Corduroy is a charming addition to anyone's collection. It is a very sweet story about the owner of Corduroy who leaves him in the laundry and has some difficulties retrieving him. Children can relate to that quite well. Getting him back is a good lesson in itself. Sewing the pocket on for him is delightful. It has a happy ending which is most enjoyable. Further note, when I read the Corduroy books to little people, I always tried to have an example of corduroy material with me - either on as pants, etc. Some of the children did not know what corduroy was.

She also has velcro on her feet and wings so I plan to hang her on the handle of my daughter's Easter basketwhich I know she will love as she adores the book so much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ...

It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.\\n\\nI find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.\\n\\nThe brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.\\n\\nThat said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.\\n\\nEverything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.\\n\\nInitially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.\\n\\nUltimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.\\n\\nI was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.  ...

The material does seem a bit cheap, but it looks nice enough and he likes it, which is what really matters. He LOVES all of the many pockets. There's always a place to keep whatever they've given him at church that day. He has one of the Adventure Bibles that clasps shut, which means we weren't able to take advantage of slipping the front and back covers into the case. Instead, he just clasps the Bible shut and places it in the case. That's fine though, it'd be that way with any case he got for it. It'd be hard to read it in the case anyway when he's got the pockets crammed full of stuff. The handle seems pretty secure, but I guess I could see that the material it's attached to could rip if it were treated casually. I've told him that he can carry it by the handle, but I've asked him not to swing it around by the handle because other reviewers have said it can fall off easily. So far, so good. All in all, nice case to fit the Adventure Bible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ...

You receive a zippered case with handles, Bible cover, long strap, a pad, a pen, and a highlighter. I was only looking for a Bible Cover for my Hindi BSI (OV). The price for this whole set was fabpriceulous, as many covers alone were the price of this set! I ordered 3 colors: Black, Green, and Pink. I am happy with my purchase. I feel that this is sturdy enough to endure daily use. The front pocket of the bag is perfect for either a small notebook or even the small tracts and handbills that I will use. Inside the bag are extending cloth pockets and attachments to attach the Bible cover inside the bag itself. The strap can be used on either the Bible cover or the bag. I had thoroughly examined the pictures of this bag, I thought - but I hadn't noticed the metal \"Cross\" zipper pulls. They were on all 3 bags that I purchased.\\nI DO like that the bag, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ...

It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with.

So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.\\n\\nEverything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.\\n\\nInitially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.\\n\\nUltimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.\\n\\nI was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.</td>\n","      <td>Works</td>\n","      <td>automotive</td>\n","      <td>I like this mini vacuum.

there. A Pocket for Corduroy is a charming addition to anyone's collection. It is a very sweet story about the owner of Corduroy who leaves him in the laundry and has some difficulties retrieving him. Children can relate to that quite well. Getting him back is a good lesson in itself. Sewing the pocket on for him is delightful. It has a happy ending which is most enjoyable. Further note, when I read the Corduroy books to little people, I always tried to have an example of corduroy material with me - either on as pants, etc. Some of the children did not know what corduroy was.

However, she is very well-made and looks exactly like the character.even more than the picture shown. She has bigger eyes and little white tufts by her ears. She also has velcro on her feet and wings so I plan to hang her on the handle of my daughter's Easter basketwhich I know she will love as she adores the book so much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ...

It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.\\n\\nI find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.\\n\\nThe brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.\\n\\nThat said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.\\n\\nEverything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.\\n\\nInitially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.\\n\\nUltimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.\\n\\nI was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.  ...

I have my large print NKJV Life Application Study Bible in the main Bible compartment. I have a mid size large print NASB in the large pocket that's across from the main Bible compartment, along with a 5x7 notepad, plus pens, pencils, highlighters. Along with the smaller NASB Bible, I have a small book that covers the Apocrypha and another small book with God's promises for quick reference...And it's still not full! It's huge, it's a beast but it does just what I want it to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ...

I have 2 blue ones for my son as well.  One at school and one at home!  The storage is GREAT!  Very deep pockets!  I've attached a video that shows you all the details and features.
